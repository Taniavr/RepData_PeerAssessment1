## Loading and preprocessing the data

```{r}
unzip( "activity.zip")
activity<- read.csv("activity.csv")
head(activity)
```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
```{r}
totalstepsday  <- aggregate(data= activity,steps~date, sum, na.rm=TRUE)
head(totalstepsday)
```

```{r}
hist(totalstepsday$steps, main="Total number of steps", xlab="steps")
```

```{r}
mean(totalstepsday$steps)
median(totalstepsday$steps)
```

## What is the average daily activity pattern?

```{r}
stepsandinterval <- aggregate(steps ~ interval, activity, mean)
```

```{r}
plot(stepsandinterval, type='l')
```

```{r}
stepsandinterval$interval[which.max(stepsandinterval$steps)]
```


## Imputing missing values
Total number of missing values
```{r}
sum(is.na(activity$steps))
```




## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
